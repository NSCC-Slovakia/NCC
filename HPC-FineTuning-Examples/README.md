# HPC-FineTuning-Examples
HPC Fine-Tuning Examples repository dedicated to providing examples and tutorials for fine-tuning language models using HPC system Devana.

## Sentiment Analysis
This repository provides scripts to train a BERT model for sentiment analysis using the Twitter dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Embedding Indices
This repository provides scripts to build BGE embeddings using the BGE-M3 model and retrieve similar documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using an Annoy index.

**Note:** Customize paths and file names as necessary based on your project structure and requirements.
The tutorial scripts download data and models from the internet. Therefore, it is necessary to use a node with access to the internet (login node) to run this script for the first time (then downloaded files are saved in cache).
