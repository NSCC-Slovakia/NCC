# HPC-FineTuning-Examples
HPC Fine-Tuning Examples repository dedicated to providing examples and tutorials for fine-tuning language models using HPC system Devana.

## Sentiment Analysis
This repository provides scripts to train a BERT model for sentiment analysis using the Twitter dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference.

## Embedding Indices
This repository provides scripts for building information retrieval tool using BGE embeddings - BGE-M3 model, to retrieve similar documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using an Annoy index.

**Note:** Customize paths and file names as necessary based on your project structure and requirements.
The tutorial scripts download data and models from the internet, so it's necessary to use a node with internet access (login node) to run these scripts for the first time. The downloaded files will then be saved in cache for subsequent runs.
